# Microcontroller Setup

The code for this repository is based on the use of the [Feather STM32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382) microcontroller. The following are additional resources for working with these microcontrollers:
- [Pin Identifiers](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/ports/stm32/boards/ADAFRUIT_F405_EXPRESS/pins.csv)
- [Using the STM32 with Micropython](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stm32f405-feather-express/micropython-setup)

All of the code for the activites uses the [current MicroPython firmware from Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stm32f405-feather-express/micropython-setup). Instructions are provided for installing using a [DFU bootloader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-stm32f405-feather-express/dfu-bootloader-details), either using a GUI (such as [STM32CubeProg](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html)) or command line ([dfu-util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/)) available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
