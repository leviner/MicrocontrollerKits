# Temperature Sensor

Micropython code needed for the [Temperature Sensor](http://www.publicsensors.org/temperature-sensor/) activities. The code in this directory will operate for the following types of microcontrollers running Micropython:
- [**Adafruit Feather STM32F405**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4382), which is used for all sensor kit activites on [PublicSensors](https://www.publicsensors.org)
- **ESP8266-based microcontrollers**
  - [HUZZAH Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471)
  - [Feather HUZZAH](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821)
-[**MicroPython pyboard v1.1**](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2390)

To complete the temperature sensor module, copy all `.py` files onto your microcontroller. Auxillary code is included in the sensor-specific folders but is not required for any PublicSensors activities.
