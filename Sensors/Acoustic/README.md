# Acoustic (Ultrasonic) Sensor

Micropython code needed for the [Acoustic Sensor](http://www.publicsensors.org/acoustic-sensor/) activities.

To complete the temperature sensor module, copy all `.py` files onto your microcontroller. Auxillary code is included in the sensor-specific folders but is not required for any PublicSensors activities.

Example assembly using STM32F405, 1602 I2C LCD and HCSR04 ultrasonic distance sensor:
