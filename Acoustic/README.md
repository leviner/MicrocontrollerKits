# Acoustic (Ultrasonic) Sensor

Micropython code needed for the [Acoustic Sensor](http://www.publicsensors.org/acoustic-sensor/) activities.

**STM32** contains code for using a 3.7v battery and LCD to operate the sensor. The sensor will also operate when run via usb and print the temperature out to terminal using the `hcsr04` library.

Assembly using 1602 LCD and HCSR04 ultrasonic distance sensor:
