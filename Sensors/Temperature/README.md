# Temperature Sensor

Micropython code needed for the [Temperature Sensor](http://www.publicsensors.org/temperature-sensor/) activities.

To complete the temperature sensor module, copy all `.py` files onto your microcontroller. Auxillary code is included in the sensor-specific folders but is not required for any PublicSensors activities.
